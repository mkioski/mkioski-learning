Wordle State

I have been working on a prototype Wordle clone to teach myself Javascript and React. I chose Wordle because it’s self-contained and I understand the requirements, but it also has room to make design changes. For example, my prototype is coded to accept six-letter words instead of five.

As it exists now, the app takes input from a text field and compares the letters to a hard-coded answer word. The correctness of each letter is shown with colors. There is enough there for the code to be reviewed before more functionality is added.

Here are some things that could be added next:

Game Functionality
	Add a “win state” if the word is guessed exactly
	Add a keyboard map as alternate input method
	Fix the algorithm to show the correct number of yellow letters
	Check the input against a dictionary so as to allow only English words
	Add a “lose state” after a certain number of incorrect guesses
	Select a random answer word for each new game

Other development functionality
	Add design to CSS so it looks nice
	Embed in web page rather than run as React App
	Add configuration to enable rules changes (variable word lengths, etc) or reusing the code in different environments
